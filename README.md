## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The interesting thing about the Base goals were the frequency that I thouht that the newer concepts (like turning a background a specific color), were going to be the hardest challenges. In reality, some of the fundamentals were what hung me up. The monthly salary calculator was sizeable obstacle that took some patience to accomplish. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the accurate way to calculate the monthly sum. It's almost embaressing how long it took. 

But this is where I realized that I had a tendency to think myself stupid in a few of these scenarios. Alot of my problems were solved by backing out of the tunnel vision I had, and asking myself how I could simplify it. I had put myself in a headspace where I felt obligated to apply it all in the render function, instead of having the math solved when the enter button was clicked and the input was absorbed into the array. 

One thing that I am struggling with is creating functions that work inside other functions. The Render function worked well enough, but I tried to create a function for my sum equations and plug it into the input function at the end. This didn't work, and I ended up having to leave it be, or else it would not allow me to post the inputs onto the dom. 

My biggest struggle was the extra, and I put a significant amount of work (by myself and with peers), to try and solve it. There were a lot of instances where I got close: i was able to clear the Dom of deleted data permanently, which felt really good. However, I discovered that my function was deleting the entire array, or the objects that I did want to keep, but keeping the representations on the DOM. 

Right now, I have a lot of concern about nesting functions in functions. I felt pretty good about the assignment as a whole, but it also felt like I was mimicing the things that I had learned this week without being able to capture the creativity of solving the bigger, stretch problems on my own. I know It's a lot to ask myself to be able to solve everything from the get go, but it can be a tad bit disheartening to see peers solve the same problems.
