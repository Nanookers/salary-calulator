## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The interesting thing about the Base goals were the frequency that I thouht that the newer concepts (like turning a background a specific color), were going to be the hardest challenges. In reality, some of the fundamentals were what hung me up. The monthly salary calculator was sizeable obstacle that took some patience to accomplish. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the accurate way to calculate the monthly sum. It's almost embaressing how long it took. 

But this is where I realized that I had a tendency to think myself stupid in a few of these scenarios. Alot of my problems were solved by backing out of the tunnel vision In the monthly sum, I had to back myself up and ask myself how I could simplify it. I had put myself in a headspace where I felt obligated to apply it all in the render function, instead of having the math solved on click of the enter button and the input was absorbed into the array.
